Pyterall version 0.1.0

Pyterall is a python script that can run terminal commands and print 
the output live

Example:
    pyterall ls /user/{user}/Desktop
    >> Will print all the files from Desktop
    pyterall sudo pacman -Syyu 
    >> Will print [sudo] password for {user}:
    >> And you will need to input the password and after that
    ... it will print the pacman that refreshes the package list

Feel free to change/edit what u want.
